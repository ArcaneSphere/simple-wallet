# simple-wallet

This is a simple Dero wallet built using Fyne.

**This software is alpha stage software, use only for testing and evaluation purposes.**

## Caveats

This program uses the following derohe version: 

`{"Version": "3.5.3-140.DEROHE.STARGATE+13062023"}`

It has been demonstrated to contain a re-use of randomness vulnerability affecting transaction data privacy that makes it possible to decrypt transaction data. **As such, there are no claims of privacy or security with this program. It is intended for testing and evaluation purposes only.**

# Why I made simple-wallet 

I woke up one day with the distinct impression I wanted a wallet that was simple, yet feature-full. 

The core focus was to bring a few underlying Dero tools to the surface: 
- file signing/verification
- self/recipient encryption/decryption
- integrated address generation 

Initial feedback suggested a contract installer/interactor would be useful, and a Pong server would be a fun addition ‚Äî historically speaking, I enjoy Pong servers. :)

# Installation

You will need Go, and a newer version is recommended. Fyne has its own set of dependencies: [https://docs.fyne.io/started/](https://docs.fyne.io/started/)

If you have handled dependencies and have a properly configured Go environment, you can install `simple-wallet`.

If you would like to build from source:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-wallet
cd simple-wallet
go build .
./simple-wallet
```

Or you can simply run the program:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/secretnamebasis/simple-wallet
cd simple-wallet
go run .
```

# Development

The basic design pattern for this application has been:

- Define a program hyperlink.
- Construct a dialog for content to display.
- Make the hyperlink's OnTapped function display the dialog.
- Load a container with hyperlinks.

Some other developments that could be useful:
- Expand the public node list
- Mobile application for android devices
- Multiple desktop environments, there have been zero tests in Microsoft, Android or MacOS environments ‚Äî strongly doubt iOS app would ever happen.

There are many additional Dero-related technologies that could be integrated into this program:

- Native Explorer, Miner, Daemon
- Civilware Integrations:
  - ENCRYPTED_DEFAULT_PAYLOAD_CBOR_V2
  - Gnomon integration (likely via an RPC/WS connection, versus within the program)
  - XSWD Websocket
  - Tela Installer & Server
  - Epoch Management
